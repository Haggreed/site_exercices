        <p>Synopsis: "The Kyoda player asks for your help! Join the Darwin's Game and fly to his rescue!" Kaname Sudo's life is turned upside down the day these few seemingly innocuous words appear on her mobile phone. He has the misfortune to accept the invitation. As soon as he is bitten in the neck by a virtual snake that emerges from the screen, he is now a slave to a merciless game, Darwin's Game, a veritable urban arena in which participants interconnected via a social network confront each other in duels to the death. Very quickly, the high school student has to face the facts: even if he tries to escape the game, his opponents, attracted by the lure of gain and the thrill of combat, will do anything to find him...</p>
